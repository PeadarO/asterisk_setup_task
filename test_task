Linux Test Task

+1. Create VM with latest stable Ubuntu  server 
	download Ubunntu 18
	install in VirtualBox
		install with shared drive
		provide 4 GB of mem
	set up with Vagrant

+2. Disable firewall
	$ ufw disable
	$ ufw status
		status: inactive

+3. Set up static IP address , e.g. 10.50.50.21
	in /etc/network/interfaces ?
	set up in Vagrantfile with "config vm.public ip 10.50.50.21"

4. Configure ssh console access to this VM 
	Vagrant provides ssh access by default
	$ vagrant ssh

5. Download source code for latest stable asterisk (15.x)
	git clone -b 15.4 http://gerrit.asterisk.org/asterisk asterisk-15.4

6. Figure out necessary dependencies to build asterisk. Install dependencies through package manager
	make list of dependencies: apt show asterisk (dendencies?)
		
7. Configure asterisk build to enable "chan_sip" and manager modules
	what is chan_sip:

8. Configure asterisk build options to enable maximum level of debugging  (threads, memory leaks, etc)
	check "max debug level" in configure script

9. Build asterisk 
	./configure
	make 

10. Install asterisk and sample config files
	make install: what exactly config files ?

11. Configure asterisk to 
a. Chan sip â€“ to listen to 10.50.50.21 
b. Enable manager module and configure to listen to 10.50.50.21

12. Configure asterisk logging level to verbose and debug (100)
	in asterisk config files

13. Launch asterisk , check logs, make sure there are no errors in the log
	this gotta be fun !!! ))

14. Verify that asterisk is running on the background
	ps/top ?

15. Verify that asterisk is listening to 10.50.50.21 udp port 5060 and tcp port 5038
	ss -ntlp / ps ?

16. Configure asterisk to auto-start when the VM starts (after each reboot)
	apparetnly sysctl (we are in ub 18 guys)

17. Configure asterisk to dump core to /tmp
	how to dump program core to /tmp

18. Install debugging and profiling tools
	gprof / valgrind / gdb

19. Figure out how to start asterisk in debug mode (using debug tools) 
	some "--debug" option is sysctl script ?

20. Figure out how to cause asterisk to crash and dump core
	update source ?


Deliverables:
1. Demo running asterisk on the VM
2. Prove  that asterisk is listening to 10.50.50.21 udp port 5060 and tcp port 5038
3. Show that there are no errors in the full asterisk log
4. Prove that asterisk is auto-starting when the OS starts
5. Show how to connect to running asterisk via debug tools
6. Show how to debug coredump  and identify source code line where the asterisk crashed
