Linux Test Task

1. Create VM with latest stable Ubuntu  server 
	download Ubunntu 18
	install in VirtualBox

2. Disable firewall
3. Set up static IP address , e.g. 10.50.50.21
4. Configure ssh console access to this VM 
5. Download source code for latest stable asterisk (15.x)
6. Figure out necessary dependencies to build asterisk. Install dependencies through package manager
7. Configure asterisk build to enable chan_sip and manager modules
8. Configure asterisk build options to enable maximum level of debugging  (threads, memory leaks, etc)
9. Build asterisk 
10. Install asterisk and sample config files
11. Configure asterisk to 
a. Chan sip â€“ to listen to 10.50.50.21 
b. Enable manager module and configure to listen to 10.50.50.21
12. Configure asterisk logging level to verbose and debug (100)
13. Launch asterisk , check logs, make sure there are no errors in the log
14. Verify that asterisk is running on the background
15. Verify that asterisk is listening to 10.50.50.21 udp port 5060 and tcp port 5038
16. Configure asterisk to auto-start when the VM starts (after each reboot)
17. Configure asterisk to dump core to /tmp
18. Install debugging and profiling tools
19. Figure out how to start asterisk in debug mode (using debug tools) 
20. Figure out how to cause asterisk to crash and dump core


Deliverables:
1. Demo running asterisk on the VM
2. Prove  that asterisk is listening to 10.50.50.21 udp port 5060 and tcp port 5038
3. Show that there are no errors in the full asterisk log
4. Prove that asterisk is auto-starting when the OS starts
5. Show how to connect to running asterisk via debug tools
6. Show how to debug coredump  and identify source code line where the asterisk crashed
